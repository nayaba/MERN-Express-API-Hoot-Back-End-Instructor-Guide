# Express API - Hoot Back-End

## About

In this module, students will build a backend for the Hoot blogging platform using Express and MongoDB. They will create a RESTful API that supports full CRUD functionality for blog posts and comments. Throughout the module, students will focus on designing RESTful routes, managing data relationships with MongoDB, and testing API endpoints with tools like Postman. This practical experience will equip students with essential backend development skills and prepare them for building a full-stack `MERN` application.

## Prerequisites

- JWT Authentication in Express APIs
- MongoDB Atlas
- Postman
