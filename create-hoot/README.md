# Express API - Hoot Back-End - Create Hoot

## AAU, I should be able to create a hoot post.

- implement and test a POST route, allowing them to securely add new blog posts

### Create a test route and router at `/hoots`

```jsx
// server.js

app.post('/hoots', (req, res) => {res.send('The /hoots route is working'});
```

### Test the route in Postman

1. Locate the **Add a request** button:
    - We need to make a new Postman request called **Create**.

    - Change the request type to a **POST** request, and provide the URL that matches the signup route:

    ```
    http://localhost:3000/hoots
    ```

3. Be sure to click the **Save** button

### Create a `hootsRouter`

```bash
touch controllers/hoots.js
```

Add the following boilerplate to `controllers/hoots.js`.

```jsx
// controllers/hoots.js

const express = require('express');
const verifyToken = require('../middleware/verify-token.js');
const router = express.Router();

// ========== Public Routes ===========

// ========= Protected Routes =========

router.use(verifyToken);

module.exports = router;
```

Cut our route from server.js and make some adjustments
```js
// app ---> router and '/hoots' ---> '/'
router.post('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('The /hoots route is working')
})
```

In `server.js`, let's import the `hootsRouter` and add it to our `'/hoots'` route.

Add the following to `server.js`:

```jsx
// server.js

const hootsRouter = require('./controllers/hoots.js');
```

And mount the router:

```jsx
// server.js

app.use('/hoots', hootsRouter);
```

### Test the route in Postman

# ‚òëÔ∏è Check Trello (2/)

## Define the route

Next we'll define a route that listens for `POST` requests on `'/hoots'`:

```
POST /hoots
```

Add the following to `controllers/hoots.js`:

```jsx
// controllers/hoots.js

// ========= Protected Routes =========

router.use(verifyToken);

router.post('/', async (req, res) => {});
```

> üèÜ Any route that requires auth should go below `router.use(verifyToken)`. These are our **Protected Routes**. A user needs to be logged in to create a hoot, so we should define our new route inside the **Protected Routes** section of `controllers/hoots.js`.

> üí° In `server.js`, we defined a base path of `/hoots` for our `hootsRouter`. Therefore, we will provide the `router` above with a path of `/`, as this will be appended to the end of what is defined in `server.js`.

## Code the controller function

Let's breakdown what we'll accomplish inside our controller function.

First, before creating a `hoot`, we'll append `req.user._id` to `req.body.author`. This updates the form data that will be used to create the resource, and ensures that the logged in user is marked as the `author` of a `hoot`.

Next, we'll call `create()` on our `Hoot` model, and pass in `req.body`. The `create()` method will return a new `hoot` document. The `author` property of this document **will only contain an ObjectId**, as the data has not yet been populated. In lieu of the `populate()` method, we'll append a complete `user` object to the `hoot` document, as `user` is already accessible on our request object (`req`).

> üí° Without this step, newly submitted hoots on the client-side would not be able to immediately render information about the author.

Once the new `hoot` is created, we'll send a JSON response with the new `hoot` object.

Add the following to `controllers/hoots.js`:

```jsx
// controllers/hoots.js

router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    req.body.author = req.user._id;
    const hoot = await Hoot.create(req.body);
    hoot._doc.author = req.user;
    res.status(201).json(hoot);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    res.status(500).json(error);
  }
});
```

> üí° When we call Mongoose's `create()` method, the newly created document is not just a plain JavaScript object, but an instance of a **Mongoose document**. Before being converted to JSON, this document adds another layer to the structure of a `hoot`, including a `_doc` property containing the document that was retrieved from MongoDB. Normally, we don't need to concern ourselves with this detail, but because we are modifying the `author` property before issuing a response, we'll need to go through the `_doc` property of `hoot`, to access the actual document.

## Test the route in Postman

Now that we have finished the route let's test it with Postman. We'll do this by sending a `POST` request to `http://localhost:3000/hoots`.

Recall that our `hootSchema` has the following specifications:

```js
// models/hoot.js

const hootSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    title: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    text: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    category: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      enum: ['News', 'Sports', 'Games', 'Movies', 'Music', 'Television'],
    },
    author: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
    comments: [commentSchema],
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);
```

In **Postman**, make a new `POST` request called **Create**.

![Add request](./assets/add-request.png)

> ‚ùó Be sure to add this request to your **Hoot** collection.

Add the following URL:

```
http://localhost:3000/hoots
```

Since this request requires authentication, we'll need to give **Postman** access to our token from the previous step.

Select the **Authorization** tab, and make sure the **Type** is set to **Inherit auth from parent**.

![Auth](./assets/auth.png)

Within the **Body** tab, select **raw**, and change the **Text** dropdown to **JSON**. Next, add the following test data to the body:

```json
{
  "title": "Big News",
  "category": "News",
  "text": "hoot Text"
}
```

Your request in **Postman** should look something like this. Note the changed values highlighted below, and don‚Äôt forget to save:

If your request was successful, you should see something like the response below:
