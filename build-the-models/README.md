# ![Express API - Hoot Back-End - Build the Models](./assets/hero.png)

- define and export a mongoose model for use with an Express API.

## Create the model file `models/hoot.js`

Next we'll add the `models/hoot.js` file.

# âœ¨ Use the ERD to define the model âœ¨

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
touch models/hoot.js
```

> ðŸ’¡ We use a **singular** naming convention for model files, as a single file will always export just one model.

## Create the `hootSchema`

Before we're able to define our schema and model, we must first import the `mongoose` library into `models/hoot.js`:

```js
// models/hoot.js

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
```

Next we'll define the schema, which will act as a blueprint for the shape of `hoot` data in our database.

Update `models/hoot.js` with the following:

```js
// models/hoot.js

const hootSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    title: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    text: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    category: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      enum: ['News', 'Sports', 'Games', 'Movies', 'Music', 'Television'],
    },
    author: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);
```

> ðŸ’¡ Notice this inclusion of `{ timestamps: true }`. This will give our `hoot` documents `createdAt` and `updatedAt` properties. We can use the `createdAt` property when we want to display the date a hoot post was made.

### Introducing Enum

- **What is Enum?**
  - `Enum`, short for "enumeration," is a special data type that restricts a variable to have one of only a few predefined values.
  - Think of it as a way to ensure that a property can only be set to a limited set of possible values, which helps maintain data integrity and consistency.

- **Why Use Enum for Category?**
  - By using an enum for the `category` property, we can limit the values to a specific list, such as `['News', 'Sports', 'Games', 'Movies', 'Music', 'Television']`.
  - This restriction ensures that users or developers cannot mistakenly assign a category outside of these predefined options.


### Real-World Analogy

Imagine a dropdown menu for selecting a category in a blog post creation form. By using an enum, you ensure that the dropdown only offers valid categories, preventing users from entering arbitrary text and maintaining consistency across all posts.  (You might think what's the point of doing this if you make a drop down menu on your front end, but ee're keeping in mind hackers like Denis who might manipulate our front end)


## Register the model

Now that we've defined our schema, we'll tell Mongoose to create a collection in MongoDB and validate that collection's data using the schema. We do this using the `mongoose.model` method:

```js
// models/hoot.js

const Hoot = mongoose.model('Hoot', hootSchema);
```

## Export the model

Finally, we'll export the `Hoot` model so that the rest of our application has access to it:

```js
// models/hoot.js

module.exports = Hoot;
```

## Create the `commentSchema`

The last step is to define a `commentSchema` in `models/hoot.js`. The `commentSchema` will be embedded inside `hootSchema`, meaning each `hoot` document will contain its own associated comments. These comment subdocuments will be accessible through a `comments` property on a `hoot`.

Much like the `hootSchema`, the `commentSchema` will store a reference to the `author` and include `createdAt` and `updatedAt` `timestamps`.

Add the following to `models/hoot.js`:

```js
// models/hoot.js

const commentSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    text: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    },
    author: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);
```

> ðŸ’¡ We don't need to compile the `commentSchema` into a model, or export it, as it is embedded inside the parent `hootSchema`. As a result, any functionality related to the `comments` resource will need to go through the `Hoot` first.

Next we'll need to update the `hootSchema` with a `comments` property:

```js
// models/hoot.js

    author: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
    comments: [commentSchema]
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);
```
